# My First Ever Tandem Jump
This post is not about computers and electronics. It is about my lifelong dream of flying! 
Life is not perfect, but it does not mean we cannot make little changes here and there to feel truly alive.  

## Tandem Jump
I have not looked up the definition, but basically, you wear a special harness around your body and get on a plane with an experienced skydiving instructor.
On the plane, the instructor will attach the hooks and jump off at an altitude of 4000. The whole process from jumping to landing takes less than 300 seconds. 

## Safety
Just make sure not to consume any alcohol. Stay hydrated and have something to eat an hour or two before the jump. It seems that not looking down when free-falling helps with dizziness.

The idea behind `PocketZotero` is to provide Android users with a simple application to access their `zotero` databases on their local storage (smartphone's internal/external storage or a shared folder via MS-SMB). There are some options in Google Play Store but they mostly lack the privacy that a fully offline client could offer. `PocketZotero` is open-source and still a work-in-progress. It's GUI is not the best and it still needs a lot of work to make it look professional, but it offers the fimiliar look and feel of `zotero`.

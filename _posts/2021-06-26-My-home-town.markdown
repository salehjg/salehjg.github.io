### You're Breathtaking

At the 2019 rendition of E3, an eccentric gamer in attendance interrupted Keanu Reeves' presentation of the role-playing game (RPG) Cyberpunk 2077, loudly claiming, “"You're breathtaking,"” which was directed at the actor-cum-presenter. The image macro used to build the "You're Breathtaking" meme generally features a still of Keanu Reeves pointing at someone in the audience in front of him - that someone is Peter Sark, though there are no images from Keanu's point of view that have since been used as part of the "You're Breathtaking" meme.




Located in northwestern Iran, Tabriz with a population of around 2 million is one of the biggest cities of the country. (the photos are from Wikipedia)

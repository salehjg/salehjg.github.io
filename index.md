# Welcome!
> Hi there! My name is Saleh Jamali Golzar. I am from northwest Iran and I speak three languages (Azeri, Persian, and English). I have received my BSc and MSc in Electrical Engineering from the electrical and computer engineering department of the University of Tabriz, Iran in 2016 and 2019 respectively and now I am seeking to continue my education in PhD. Having a background in embedded systems and circuit design, my current research mostly includes heterogeneous computing (FPGA, GPU), machine learning, and computer architecture.
